=================================
1/ Reasoning based form generator
=================================

The problem
-----------

Most software, currently designed, is making compromises as it comes to
the choice between being generic and being specific. It is impossible
to define - up-front - software screens that are adapted for 100 % to
the specific needs of the user and the involved tasks he has to perform.
The more generically the screens are designed the more maintainable the
software becomes, but the less optimized the application becomes.
Moreover, the technology used for defining screens and forms, be it
generic or specific, is still pretty much 'hard wired' into the code.
This makes any change in context (user, goal, environment) difficult to
implement.

The goal
--------

Based on a formal description of the task to execute, the available or
needed information, the user preferences, the visual style guides and
behavioral policies and the system environment (web, operating system,
display, ...), an (existing) reasoning engine will be used to generate
an ad hoc formal description of a form that then can be rendered and
used by a user. Advantage of such a system is a much more generic
paradigm of application design, enabling flexibility, controlled by
externally declared knowledge. Advantage for the user is that he will
deal with exactly that what he needs to do the job, optimally adapted
to his preferences and working environment. The built system will focus
on a small subset of a healthcare application where –for demonstration
purposes – different changes of context (style guides, user
preferences, ...) will be implemented.
Challenges are 1) the formalization of style guides, behavior, user
preferences 2) the performance 3) the reasoning and rules driving
the system.


=====================
2/ Ontology mediation
=====================

The problem
-----------

More and more there is a need in healthcare to share clinical
information and workflow across multiple health care providers. Until
now, these interoperability problems have always been solved by hard
coded connectivity platforms, based on the HL7 standard. So far, mostly
administrative data were exchanged and when it came to clinical
information, only free text documents were shared. The next generation
of clinical software requires structured information with and
unambiguous semantics. To make the picture even more complicated,
different incompatible standards are emerging (HL7 v3, CDA, OpenEHR,
13606, ...).

The goal
--------

Using Semantic Web technology a connectivity platform will be designed
in such a way that semantic interoperability between 2 hospital systems
will be achieved. To be realistic and feasible, only a subset of
clinical data will be used. Based on a formal description of a common
data set ('internal ontology') holding the best ideas and common
structures from the most prominent standards (HL7, OpenEHR), but
focused on a realistic subset, an adapter will be made between 2
clinical system and the internal ontology. A proof of concept will be
built where a patient summary will be visualized showing distributed
clinical data, coming from both systems. This means that a hospital 1
has to be able to launch a query, defined on a semantic level, that
this query will be sent to the internal adapter and to the adapter of
hospital 2 and that the results will be merged and visualized.


====================================================
3/ Using Bayesian inference for clinical data mining
====================================================

The problem
-----------

Medical knowledge evolves by doing fundamental medical research
confirmed in clinical trials. The problem of clinical trials is that,
due to the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, very often the
results are not usable or comparable within clinical practice.
This is because clinical trials make a 'nice picture of a dirty world'.
The contradiction is that the better the clinical trial is, the better
you can prove a physiological relationship, but the farther away you
are from reality. On the other hand, in health care information systems
there is a huge amount of relevant clinical data, just waiting to be
explored. This clinical data is a result of real day to day clinical
care and gives us the 'real picture'. Both approaches are useful and
needed, but we need the best of both.

The goal
--------

Based on Bayesian inference on real clinical data, relationships and
rules will be inducted. The dependency from context, and the
physiological relationship is expressed in sensitivity and specificity
(ROC curve). The fact that in Bayesian relationship the context is
defined explicitly, can be exploited to have the best of both
approaches, described above.. It will lead to a system where still
the physiological relationship can be defined, but where also the
context can be calculated in a very explicit way, such that – given
other contexts – the results of the mining can be transferred to
another environment, making them much more usable. Finding a
relationship between both approaches can make future medical research,
cheaper and more usable. In the data mining framework to be built,
the mining algorithms and parameters will be inferred by using
previous results and generic knowledge to make even the data mining
activity itself the result of reasoning.


====================================
4/ Clinical Decision Support Systems
====================================

The problem
-----------

Few commercial healthcare information systems provide a full complement
of proactive decision support. The richness of applying a broad range
of medical knowledge to influence physicians' orders through the
responsible, appropriate use of (both discrete and probabilistic)
knowledge representation is still an unachieved goal.

The goal
--------

Only when both patient data and clinical knowledge reside in the system
in machine-understandable format can the system provide additional
support to the clinician making decisions. For example, encoded medical
knowledge about the meaning and significance of changing laboratory-test
results would allow a system to provide alerts, an active function, in
addition to the passive data retrieval function. Similarly, if the
system could match the patient context with relevant clinical
guidelines, it could present ordering options consistent with the
appropriate guidelines. The clinician is responsible for the definitive
decision, but the system can actively provide options and explanations
that improve the clinician's efficiency and compliance with accepted
guidelines of practice.


============================
5/ Semantic Interoperability
============================

The problem
-----------

Research & Development in the field of Semantic Interoperability
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability) in order to
provide a knowledge framework for future usage and identifying the needs
for knowledge management (onthologies). Since a couple of years Agfa is
investing in the research of Semantic Web technologies together with
the W3C, those technologies became mature enough for a real world
implementation of which we would like to benefit within the labour
intensive interoperability world in Healthcare. This in order to improve
inter hospital and system exchange capabilities as well as lowering the
cost of implementation.

The goal
--------

The first step towards such a framework is combining the 'triplets'
technology from our research department with the BPE framework of the
interoperability development department, providing a toolset that could
support multiple HL7v3 versions, formats, localizations using a single
knowledge repository.


=======================================
6/ A Proof Checker for the Semantic Web
=======================================

The problem
-----------

Agfa HealtCare develops semantic web applications based on reasoning
results using medical knowledge and clinical data. This reasoning
results are automatically generated with the help of theorem provers.
Automatic theorem provers are complex pieces of software and there
is no guarantee that the proofs are correct. Proofs are fragile
entities in that one misstep typically makes the whole proof incorrect.

The goal
--------

An extra 'sanity check' consists of checking all proofs with an
independent proof checker. The proof checker doesn't build a proof
but checks wether a given proof is a correct proof for the given
theorem. The goal is to develop such a open source proof checker.
An example of such a proof checker is the W3C Cwm proof checker
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/check.py using the proof ontology
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/reason.n3 as illustrated in test case
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Jan/0019.html
The work comprises studying the semantic web logic N3Logic,
studying the N3 rulesets and proofs used in our advanced clinical
applications, building the proof checker and evaluating the proof
checker within those advanced clinical applications.


===================================
7/ FCM for medical decision support
===================================

The problem
-----------

Few commercial healthcare information systems provide a full complement
of proactive decision support. The richness of applying a broad range
of medical knowledge to influence physicians' orders through the
responsible, appropriate use of (both discrete and probabilistic)
knowledge representation is still an unachieved goal.

The goal
--------

Recently Elpiniki Papageorgiou suggested new methodologies for FCMs for
medical decision support, such as evolutionary FCMs for time-series
prediction, Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Maps and Intuitionistic FCMs, which
are really very promising appoaches for medical decision making. Maybe
it would be interesting to implement them in semantic web and to create
ontological new FCMs for decision support.
